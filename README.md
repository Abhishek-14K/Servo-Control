# Servo-Control

Using the STM32L476RG, run two servos at the same time such that the operation of one servo does not block that of the other servo. The servo should follow a recipe of commands along with any user commands encountered during operation. The LEDs on MFS should act like an indicator of the current operation. Finally, write a recipe command of your own choice to be used as part of the recipe.
